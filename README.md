Video Monitor
=============

This is an example app (written [web2py](http://web2py.com), Python, and JavaScript) that 
monitors your webcam and when there is motion, records short videos
and uploads them to the server. It also tags the videos based on date,
color, and human detection (performed client side). 
Uploaded videos are searchable by tags.

You can try it in demo mode (no actual uploads) here:
